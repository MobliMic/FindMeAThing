Resources are resources specific to your project, seperated by type.

The standard naming convention is to use a . before the name of the language if that language has to be compiled.

For example:
.js -> js
.dart -> dart
.scss -> css (each file is automatically appended with .scss)
.less -> css (each file is automatically appended with .less)
images (is not compiled)
